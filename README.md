# MinecraftChecker
Credential stuffing program for Minecraft. This program was made for educational purposes only. I am not responsible for what you use this for.

## Warning: Shit code.
This program were written on 2019, I was noob of Python.


## Installation
1. Install the latest version of Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Use the `pip` command to install the requirements
```bash
pip install requests
pip install cmdscreen
pip install ctypes
```
## Usage
1. Make a new file called `users.txt`, and put all of your accounts in it formatted as `user:pass`
2. Open terminal in your program directory, then type `py app.py` to start checking

## Note
Mojang shadow bans IPs that log into a large amount of accounts. Therefore, you will probably not get many hits after the ~20 or so account mark. In order to bypass this, you will need to implement your own proxy system with residential proxies/very good proxies at least.
